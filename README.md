# Time Series Analysis of Website Traffic

This project analyzes website traffic data to identify trends, seasonality, and forecast future views.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is "Thecleverprogrammer.csv," which contains daily website views over a period of time.

## Analysis

The analysis involves the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Loading the dataset, converting the "Date" column to datetime format, and exploring the data.
2. **Visualizing Website Traffic:** Creating line plots to visualize the trends and patterns in website views over time.
3. **Seasonal Decomposition:** Decomposing the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components using the `seasonal_decompose` function.
4. **Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation:** Examining autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots to identify potential ARIMA model parameters.
5. **SARIMA Modeling:** Building a Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model to capture the time series patterns and make predictions.
6. **Forecasting:** Generating forecasts for future website views using the fitted SARIMA model.
7. **Evaluation:** Evaluating the model performance and visualizing the predictions against the actual data.


## Libraries Used

The project utilizes the following libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- statsmodels

## Usage

To run this analysis, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed and the dataset available. Execute the code cells in the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script sequentially.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into the website traffic patterns, including any seasonality or trends. The SARIMA model forecasts future website views, which can be used for planning and decision-making.

## Further Development

Potential improvements and extensions for this project include:

- Exploring alternative forecasting models, such as Prophet or Exponential Smoothing.
- Incorporating external factors, such as marketing campaigns or seasonal events, into the model.
- Evaluating different model parameters and optimization techniques.
- Developing interactive visualizations to explore the results.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of time series analysis techniques to understand and predict website traffic. The findings can be valuable for website owners and content creators to optimize their strategies and achieve their goals.
